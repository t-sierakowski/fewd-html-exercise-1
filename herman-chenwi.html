    Of Patterns and Power: Web Standards Then & Now
  </h1>
  <p>
    IN <a href="http://danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/">"CONTENT Display Patterns"</a> (which all front-end
    folk should read), Dan Mall points to a truth not
    unlike the one <a href="http://danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/">Ethan Marcotte shared las Month</a> on <i>24
    ways</i>. It is truth as old as standards-based design: Construct
    your markup to properly support your content (not your design).
  </p>

  <p>
    Modular/<a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">atomic design</a> doesn’t change this truth, it
    just reinforces its wisdom. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">Flexbox</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">grid layout</a> don’t
    change this truth, they just make it easier to do it better.
    <a href="https://html5forwebdesigners.com/design/index.html">HTML5</a> doesn’t change this truth, it just reminds us that the
    separation of structure from style came into existence for a
    reason. A reason that hasn’t changed. A reason that cannot
    change, because it is the core truth of the web, and is
    inextricably bound up with the promise of this medium.
  </p>

  <P>
    Separating structure from style and behavior was the web standards
     movement’s prime revelation, and each generation of web designers
     discovers it anew. This separation is what makes our content as
     backward-compatible as it is forward-compatible (or “future-friendly,
     ” if you prefer). It’s the key to re-use. The key to accessibility.
     The key to the new kinds of CMS systems we’re just beginning to dream up.
     It’s what makes our content as accessible to an ancient device as it will
     be to an unimagined future one.
