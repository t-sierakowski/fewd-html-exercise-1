        <p>IN <a href="http://danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/">"CONTENT Display Patterns"</a>
          (which all front-end folk should read), Dan Mall points to a truth not unlike the one
          <a href="https://24ways.org/2015/putting-my-patterns-through-their-paces/">Ethan Marcotte shared last month</a>
          on <i>24 ways</i>. It is a truth as old as standards-based design:
          <mark>Construct your markup to properly support your content (not your design).</mark>
        </p>
        <p>Modular/
          <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">atomic design</a>
          doesn’t change this truth, it just reinforces its wisdom.
          <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">Flexbox</a> and
          <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">grid layout </a>
          don’t change this truth, they just make it easier to do it better.
          <a href="https://html5forwebdesigners.com/design/index.html">HTML<sub>5</sub></a>
          doesn't change this truth, it just reminds us that the separation of structure from style came into existence for a reason. A reason that hasn’t changed. A reason that cannot change, because it is the core truth of the web, and is inextricably bound up with the promise of this medium.
